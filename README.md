# Employee Tracker

# Description
  This week's project is to create an interface that would allow non-developers to interact with information stored in a database. My application allows business owners to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company so that they can run their business accordingly. 


  Here's a demo link that demonstrates the functionality of the application: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v-2V0I-26KHnuDGxey4WZQu65SoqtJq_/view?usp=sharing
